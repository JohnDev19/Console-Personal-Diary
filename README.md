# Personal Diary Application

A simple personal diary application built in Ruby that allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and search diary entries. The application is console-based and stores entries in a JSON file for persistent data management.

## Features

- Create new diary entries
- View all diary entries
- Edit existing diary entries
- Delete diary entries
- Search entries by keyword
- Data persistence using JSON file

## Data Storage
The diary entries are stored in a JSON file named data.json. This file is created automatically when you save your first entry. You can view and edit this file directly if needed.

## Future Enhancements
- User Authentication: Implement login/logout functionality to secure diary entries.
- Data Backup: Add a feature to back up entries to a different file.
- Text Formatting: Allow users to format their entries (e.g., bold, italics).
- Tags and Categories: Introduce tagging and categorization for entries.
- Web Interface: Create a web-based version of the diary app using Ruby on Rails or Sinatra.
- Search Filters: Enhance the search functionality to filter by date ranges or tags.
